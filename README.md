# virtual-pet
This is my first virtual pet that I have created. I included some illustrations and icons using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I decided to give my virtual pet more than three stats.

Project from SBCD instructors:
At the end of this portion of the project, you will have completed the Virtual Pet project started in part 1. It will include 3 buttons that will increase (and decrease) your pet’s stats. Your pet will “react” to it’s state by changing it’s image.
